Mission Statement 

The STAMV Club is a club that is focused on creating tools that students can use to enhance their studies. These tools would be more catered towards MVHS students. For example, students would be able to attach multiple definitions to terms. This would be beneficial in classes such as math and history as terms often have multiple details attached to them.

We currently have the website hosted at url.mvhs.io/stamv. We created it from scratch, and our goal is to continue working on it in the future to completion.

Our Mission
Our club is focused on creating a website focused around providing helpful study tools for students such as customizable quizzes and flashcards. These quizzes and flashcards will be shareable so students can use these tools in study groups, allowing for a large number of people to benefit from them. Additionally, this website will be public to allow anyone to be able to use our programs at no cost.

The Programs We Make
Our website will be equipped with a multitude of programs and tools designed to help students learn. So far we are planning on implementing a flash card program that will help students memorize definitions of words or ideas and other similar programs. We will also be using public input to generate ideas on which methods and studying devices will be most effective. The tools will be made using HTML and java.

Our Motive
At STAMV we have 1 main motive. This motive is to provide students with a reliable way to learn and study by creating programs geared towards this on our website. Because Quizlet no longer offers free custom quizzes without a premium account, we felt it best to provide a solution by making our own platform to make and share quizzes, among other things beneficial to studying and helping students learn.
